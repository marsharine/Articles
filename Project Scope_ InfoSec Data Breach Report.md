### **Project Scope: InfoSec Data Breach Trend Analysis & Security Report**

#### **Project Overview:**

The **InfoSec Data Breach Trend Analysis & Security Report** project aims to analyze publicly available data breach information to uncover trends and provide actionable security recommendations. Using data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, the project will identify key breach patterns, common attack vectors, and industry impacts. The insights gained will be compiled into a technical security report aimed at IT security teams and business leaders, helping them enhance their security posture.

#### **Objective:**

* To perform an in-depth analysis of data breaches over recent years.  
* To visualize key trends, such as breach frequency, industry-specific risks, and the most common attack vectors.  
* To create a technical report with recommendations on preventing data breaches, based on data insights.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Data Breach Trend Analysis**:  
   * Visualize trends in breach frequency, industries impacted, and common attack methods.  
   * Use publicly available data sources to gather insights on breaches worldwide.  
2. **AI and Data Visualization**:  
   * Develop interactive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI to allow users to explore breach trends.  
   * Highlight key patterns such as geographic and sectoral vulnerabilities.  
3. **Technical Report**:  
   * Compile findings from the analysis into a comprehensive technical document.  
   * Provide actionable recommendations based on the data, targeting both IT professionals and business decision-makers.  
4. **Public Dashboard**:  
   * Host interactive data breach visualizations using Google Firebase or another hosting service.  
   * Ensure that visualizations can be accessed publicly, showcasing your portfolio skills.

#### **Technology Stack:**

* **Data Analysis**: Tableau, Power BI  
* **Hosting**: Google Firebase  
* **Data Sources**: Publicly available breach databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned, InfoSec websites)  
* **Technical Writing**: Google Docs / MS Word for drafting the report
